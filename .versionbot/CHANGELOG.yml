      hash: 3e04d6e209caba0e74f2393402b877be3c398ba7
      body: |
        Ideally this shouldn't be in the worker at all or at least not tied to
        Google Meet directly in the code. We can move this later when we have
        the time, but for now exporting the functionality so we can reuse it
        in jellyfish-plugin-hubot.

      hash: 4a1360be0e1e59a76104542053b2df290bd9439e
      body: |
        The code to find dev/test contracts to skip in production was being
        executed against the wrong set of contracts. Also, the role-user-test
        contract is inserted by autumndb so trying to skip it here doesn't
        make sense.

      hash: af9221f4c3d7981fec2905b3f3355eaca6624a5e
      body: >
        This change pulls in logic from the Jellyfish UI that populates event
        metadata by parsing the message body.

        This makes behaviour more consistent and testable, especially when interacting with Jellyfish using the client SDK or directly over http instead of through the UI.


        The code was originally copied from here https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish/blob/v56.3.6/apps/ui/lib/services/helpers.ts#L971

    - subject: Only allow org members to add other users to an org
      hash: dae5c12286663b389a7d018546745dd16265a0a7
      body: >
        This change adds a check to see if the user is an org member before
        allowing link creation between user and org.

        This link is used to calculate marker permissions so needs to be specially protected.

        It also closes some other holes that would affect the ability to "join" an org.


        - Users can no longer create a link between a user and an org if they

        are not a member or creator of the org

        - When a user creates an org, they automatically become a member of the org

        - Users can no longer create "was created by" links manually, as this could be used to bypass org creator validation


        Note: This is a temporary solution until we have a better way to handle this. Once we are able to distinctly permission writes in AutumnDB, we can remove this.

      hash: 8dae10ebe040483c57c72fedff88d84dcddd4ebf
      body: >
        This change brings in the [update to
        autumndb](https://github.com/product-os/autumndb/pull/1363) that removes
        direct session handling.

        Instead of AutumnDB handling session tokens, it only deals with the identity/actor making requests. Authorization of users should be hoisted up to the route layer at the top of the call stack, where it can eventually be delegated to an external service, such as Ory Kratos.

    - subject: Fix bug where triggers are not recalculated when a relationship is added
      hash: dd360ad78d517e39700a3dda5c4d85e946507551
      body: >
        Fixes a bug where some materialized fields won't be calculated
        correctly.

        What happens is that because we now use relationships to create the triggered actions, used to process materialized fields, if you insert the relationship after the type then the triggered action won't be generated.  The triggered actions only get generated when a type contract is inserted.

        We need to changes this so that the formulas will get parsed and the appropriate triggered actions generated when a new relationship is inserted.

      hash: d9c3c416c100502a4a03f45a300915baa565662b
      body: |
        This change allows us to more quickly discard triggers that won't match
        when evaluating link contract insertions.
        The types on the trigger filter are compared to the types declared on
        the link contract, and if they don't match we can safely exit the
        trigger evaluation logic instead of having to query the kernel.

      hash: 139dda586d3600abd570730ce12cff3b8b568c73
      body: |
        Because updates to transformers, triggers and types are infrequent,
        streaming these contracts generates a lot of overhead. Switching to
        a slow polling strategy should reduce load on the DB.
        This change also adds a `stop()` method that can safely shutdown the
        worker, waiting for jobs to finish and stopping the polling.

      body: |
        Update worker to be created with a list of plugins.
        This means that all contracts provided by plugins
        are inserted into the system when the worker starts.
        Also allows us to add in the worker instance contract
        update stream. A part of bringing the API codebase
        into the worker.

      hash: 7bc274649e1c9674e94b2d6cbf9875ce72c3b479
      body: >
        This change alls brings in the `contact` contract type. The sync context

        now has the ability to link to contacts as part of it's interface so

        logically the contact is part of the core offering.

        The original `contact` definition came from here: https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish-plugin-default/blob/v24.0.44/lib/contracts/contact.ts

        The `getReferencedLinkVerbs()` utility function in jellyscript will be
        deprecated soon. Contract and Jellyfish specific functionality needs to
        be migrated into the worker.

        We should avoid exporting with default and
        instead match other modules by exporting
        a typed, named variable.

    - subject: Hoist transformer specific formulas from jellyscript
      hash: 062f50f582835e502dab2c915b7dee720786b087
      body: >
        This is a part of the ongoing effort to clean up jellyscript and to
        colocate

        transformers behaviour in a single place.

        The transformers specific formulas `NEEDS` and `NEEDS_ALL` are now

        custom formulas that live in this repo and are injected into the

        Jellyscript parser at runtime.

        As described in

        https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish-worker/pull/1348/commits/b129cde1400bbc0eb61ef0a8adabb868828f105e

        serialize-error is an esm module as of v9.x which will be a big lift for

        us to support across our stack. The original PR didn't pin the version,

        which meant that renovate auto-updated it.

      body: |
        Previously, the `request` method incorrectly typed the `actor` parameter
        as a boolean, when it's actually a string, and even worse, cast the
        request options argument as `any`.
        This change also exports useful types for use by integrations.

      body: >
        If a request to an external resource returns a failure code, the code

        should be returned as-is. The axios behaviour is to throw on a status

        code > 300, compared to the deprecated request package, which would just

        return the status code in its callback params.

        The rest of the code actually expects the >= 300 error codes and even has

        logic to handle them sanely.

    - subject: Fix error when handling circular references in error objects
      hash: b129cde1400bbc0eb61ef0a8adabb868828f105e
      body: >
        Previously, if an action handler threw an error containing a circular
        reference,

        because errio doesn't handle circular references when serializing the

        error, the kernel would attempt to insert the circular object and cause

        a fatal error.

        Switching from errio to serialize-error makes this code much safer, as

        well as moving us away from errio, which has been deprecated (the GitHub

        repo is actually archived). A confounder is that serialize-error@9.x is

        an esm module, which makes integrating it into our dependency tree a bit

        of a pain. For now I've opted to use serialize-error@8.x which is

        a commonJS package and should play nicely. I would definitely consider

        upgrading the tree to esm modules in the future.

        See:

        JS-combinatorics has a number of issues when trying to use the work
        inside a service, due to its variable interface (commonjs vs umd).
        Switching to a simpler module should help with this issue.

        - Don't export the `Plugin` class. Plugins are now defined as
        `PluginDefinition` objects.

        - Remove the ability to define contracts as functions.

        - Remove custom mixins.

        - Properly define the type for action contracts.

      body: >
        We only skip task creation if artifactReady is explicitely false, which
        means it is not ready yet. When missing, it means there is no need for
        it anyway and thus we do create it.

        Include the cache of versioned type contracts in the action context
        provided to action functions. This change allows us to utilise cache
        instead of having action functions load type contracts themselves.

      hash: b696148f7964b5d27c53039f32c64a5c47ffcf56
      body: >
        The behaviour of `Worker.replaceCard` is to always set `attachEvents` to
        false unless,

        `options.attachEvents` is true AND there is no pre-existing contract.

        The previous refactor incorrectly changed the behaviour to always ignore

        `options.attachEvents`, which has now been fixed.

        Long-term I really want to remove this method as it causes a bunch of

        headaches in the core kernel and is a bit of a hack that appears to be

        only used to bootstrap the stack.

        This change removes the indirection of having replace, insert and patch
        methods in the executor and the Worker. Now the methods are directly in
        the worker and are tested at that level as well.

      hash: 734c196f823759c1f56990af29b58a6113a840f2
      body: |
        Having the currentTime option as an option is unnecessary as it is
        always set to `new Date()`. Switching it to a local variable reduces
        complexity.

    - subject: Always re-enqueue action requests generated by triggers
      hash: c083c5c783fd277e775fec488bb25805fcf79f01
      body: |
        This change enforces that all action requests generated by triggers are
        re-enqueued. This behaviour will ensure that triggered-actions behave in
        a predictable way and prevents the situation that many high load
        actions are run asynchronously without the worker waiting for them to
        finish, resulting in unrestricted system load.
        When the action request is enqueued it is now done with the originating
        actor's session instead of a privileged session (which is how it worked
        previously). There is no longer privilege escalation when executing an
        action request generated by a triggered action.

        This change also refactors test boostrap code to remove unneeded
        abstractions and improves typing of a number of test files. Due to the
        change to triggered action behaviour a number of tests that checked the
        behaviour of triggers needed to be hoisted to a higher abstraction
        level, as the previous test cases did not use the queue. This change
        also revealed a bug where originator was not being passed when
        a triggered action is enqueued.

        This PR also converts the tests to jest and converts them to Typescript.
        We should consider if these tests should be placed alongside the actions
        they actually test in the action-library repo, however this conversion
        process is a valuable step in any case.

      hash: e3a400b4f37b1afaa7855f5c50df2cdf378f9151
      body: |
        With this change, we only load the inserted contract using the user's
        session when evaluating subscriptions, as it is redundant to
        make this request when evaluating triggered actions (the contract is
        already restricted by the session permissions in that code path)
