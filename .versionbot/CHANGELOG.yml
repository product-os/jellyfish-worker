        Include the cache of versioned type contracts in the action context
        provided to action functions. This change allows us to utilise cache
        instead of having action functions load type contracts themselves.

      hash: b696148f7964b5d27c53039f32c64a5c47ffcf56
      body: >
        The behaviour of `Worker.replaceCard` is to always set `attachEvents` to
        false unless,

        `options.attachEvents` is true AND there is no pre-existing contract.

        The previous refactor incorrectly changed the behaviour to always ignore

        `options.attachEvents`, which has now been fixed.

        Long-term I really want to remove this method as it causes a bunch of

        headaches in the core kernel and is a bit of a hack that appears to be

        only used to bootstrap the stack.

      hash: fbe060ca68b177c082db4d76e29eec4686eebf76
      body: |
        This change removes the indirection of having replace, insert and patch
        methods in the executor and the Worker. Now the methods are directly in
        the worker and are tested at that level as well.

      body: |
        Having the currentTime option as an option is unnecessary as it is
        always set to `new Date()`. Switching it to a local variable reduces
        complexity.

        Normalize trigger data format by using triggered-action contracts
        directly
      hash: b3e766957061be6606cb50f577d874448b02e22e
      body: |
        Instead of having multiple formats for triggers in the system this
        changes the worker to handle triggered-action contracts directly,
        dramatically simplifying code.

    - subject: Always re-enqueue action requests generated by triggers
      hash: c083c5c783fd277e775fec488bb25805fcf79f01
      body: |
        This change enforces that all action requests generated by triggers are
        re-enqueued. This behaviour will ensure that triggered-actions behave in
        a predictable way and prevents the situation that many high load
        actions are run asynchronously without the worker waiting for them to
        finish, resulting in unrestricted system load.
        When the action request is enqueued it is now done with the originating
        actor's session instead of a privileged session (which is how it worked
        previously). There is no longer privilege escalation when executing an
        action request generated by a triggered action.

        This change also refactors test boostrap code to remove unneeded
        abstractions and improves typing of a number of test files. Due to the
        change to triggered action behaviour a number of tests that checked the
        behaviour of triggers needed to be hoisted to a higher abstraction
        level, as the previous test cases did not use the queue. This change
        also revealed a bug where originator was not being passed when
        a triggered action is enqueued.

        This PR also converts the tests to jest and converts them to Typescript.
        We should consider if these tests should be placed alongside the actions
        they actually test in the action-library repo, however this conversion
        process is a valuable step in any case.

        caused some triggered actions to no longer run.

      hash: e3a400b4f37b1afaa7855f5c50df2cdf378f9151
      body: |
        With this change, we only load the inserted contract using the user's
        session when evaluating subscriptions, as it is redundant to
        make this request when evaluating triggered actions (the contract is
        already restricted by the session permissions in that code path)
