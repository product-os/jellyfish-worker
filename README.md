# Jellyfish Worker

Jellyfish workers are in charge of consuming action requests from the queue,
executing them, and reporting back the results. This module provides an lower
level interface to write a worker server. The intention is that we can write
multiple types of workers, optimised for different tasks using a single shared
framework.

# Usage

Below is an example how to use this library:

```js
const Worker = require('@balena/jellyfish-worker');

const worker = new Worker(
	jellyfish,
	jellyfish.sessions.admin,
	actionLibrary,
	consumer,
);
await worker.initialize(context);

const id = worker.getId();
console.log(`Worker ID: ${worker.getId()}`);
```

# Testing

The integration tests require a postgres DB and redis server. The simplest way to run the tests locally is with docker-compose.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

The tests can then be run from your host with:

```
LOGLEVEL=warn POSTGRES_USER=docker POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker make test-integration
```
